# Predicting Aviation Accident Severity: A Data-Driven Approach to Enhancing Air Travel Safety

## Overview
Air travel is one of the safest modes of transportation, but when accidents occur, they have catastrophic consequences. This project leverages data science and machine learning to predict the severity of aviation accidents, aiming to enhance air travel safety. By analyzing historical aviation data, we identify patterns and provide actionable insights to mitigate future risks.
